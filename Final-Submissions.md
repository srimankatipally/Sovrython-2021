## Increasing TVL ##
What Does TVL mean and why it so important for a protocol:
TVL means simply total value locked in smart contract. It is important metric for good liquidity for swaps of cryptos , Lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency. TVL can be seen as a metric for the popularity of a dApp when directly comparing two with similar functions. TVL can also be seen as a proxy for slippage in the case of a DEX such as Uniswap. In terms of slippage, lower TVL means there is more risk of getting an unexpectedly worse price, especially for larger trades.

How TVL can be measure:
TVL(USD) is calculated by taking these balances and multiplying them by their price in USD.” It's a methodology which mimics the way in which the market cap of cryptocurrencies is calculated. However, market cap has long been regarded as an imperfect reckoner, and the same accusation has been levied against defi.
What are factors which case to go up in TVL:
Users from other DeFi lending applications when the kinked interest rate becomes active and lending yields are driven to triple digits or higher in the underlying token with no risk of Impermanent Loss — an extremely attractive prospect. In other words, when lending and borrowing is high, yields become very high, and more users will tend to add their funds to the dApp.


Why people stared locking their assets in smart contract:
As we know due to pandemic Federal Reserve System have printed enormous amount of US Dollars to save economy but it pays some consequences like Hyperinflation ,etc.., to get out of this loop government imposes to lower the interest rate on your savings, increase interest rate on loans . So now people are looking for making more returns on at least on their saving , which unlocks them to explore different options like bonds, stocks , real estate. But in bonds they are getting very low returns , if they look at stocks they think it is too volatile , if they take real state they need huge capital which most people don’t have. Now people are looking into dapps In which they get pegged dollar , after getting pegged dollar they deposit those dollar into contract in which they get more returns

## Incentivizing Stakers in Governance ##

What is meant by Staking?
staking is when you lock an asset for a period of time in exchange for token rewards, usually as compensation for doing some useful activity or taking on a certain level of risk.
Why protocol needs Staking:
Staking is incentivized to maintain protocol safety, facilitate decentralized governance of protocol.
What can we do for increasing in number of Stakers:
 By providing more staking rewards
As Sovryn dapp have trade feature, we can rebate in trade fee or by reducing trading fee who have staked SOV
By providing somewhat more interest rates on lending and for borrowing providing less interest rate for exclusive SOV stackers

## New Business that wants to launch tokens on our Origins Platform ##

There are two types of users 
1)Who want to participate in in Origin sale
2)Team who want to launch their token sale

Who want to participate in in Origin sale?
If token sale should be fair, you must give allocations based on total sov staked on the platform
Example:
For example, total staked sov is 1000 sov in platform and there are 1000 USD worth of tokens, then
If person A stakes 10 sov , person B stakes 1 sov then A person should get 10 USD allocation and person B should get 1 USD allocation . Before sale you have collect interest people or whitelist people

Team who want to launch their token sale

Instant AMA listing after-sales period completes
Providing neat dashboard for conducting token sale
Good support where coding or marketing or for any other work
